<h1>Anna Anthropy, Rise of Videogame Zinesters: Chapter 3 and 4</h1>

<p> 1.What compels people to engage in a certain game? Why are games engaging to the public? </p>

<p> 2.Video games are the perfect portal for storytelling but what happens when the narrative is something that potentially enforces gender stereotyping? What kind of gender stereotypes can video games perpetuate? </p>

<p> 3.Even if the intention of a narrative is "to try educate the players about the dynamics at work within a horrible real-life experience, and how those dynamics might come to be a product of individual choices and responses," can't the narrative be taken in the opposite direction as well? Where the player can take the intention as being given the freedom to do whatever they want? Therefore, is video gaming an escape for people to do crazy things without facing the consequences and punishments of real life crime? </p>

<p>Question 3: I think that this is a question that is often asked in video gaming, especially when people bring up the negative impact that gaming can have on people. However, I think that this idea of escapism really depends on the player. Often times people do use video gaming as a means to escape from the unpleasant experiences of reality. But I also think that many people play games just as a hobby and as something that is taken very light-heartedly. I find it unfair when I see that there are a multitude of articles discussing the dangers of escapism through games. In a sense some of that is true, but I don't think it's right to group all gamers into this one category that depicts them as escapists. I do hope that video gaming is seen in a more positive light and that people acknowledge the benefits of gaming in addition to the dangers of it.</p>
