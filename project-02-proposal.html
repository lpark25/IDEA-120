<h1>Green Screen Proposal</h1>

<p>For the green screen project, I want to play with the illusion of size within the space of the computer screen. 
<br>I will utilize the craft of origami to create a scene. This scene will serve as the background of my zoom recording. 
<br>As the background video plays, I will interact with the elements in real time.</p>
