<h1>Project 4 proposal</h1>

My portfolio will be organized like an index. It will be split into three sections: responses, proposals, and projects. 
	<br>These sections will list all the repositories made for each assignment and display each project. 
	<br>When the user clicks on one of the links it will take them to the designated project.
