<h1>Cathy O'Neil, Weapons of Math Destruction: Chapter 4</h1>


<p> In this chapter, O'Neil and Chalabi bring to light the situation of predatory ads when using the internet. Ads that may be harmful to the public audience rather than a beneficial exposure. Further, O'Neil and Chalabi emphasize the ads that are put out by for-profit colleges. For-profit colleges operate in a business-matter and their idea of "selling education" is clearly noticeable in the way they display their ads. Personally, I can definitely relate to this topic of for-profit colleges utilizing your search histories and the websites you visited to choose you as a target. Around sophomore year of college, I decided to change my major. Because of this sudden decision, I was researching a lot about the major I wanted to switch to and the process of it. Evenutally, I realized I was getting advertisements from for-profit colleges like DeVry University and University of Phoenix. Their advertisements would bombarb my spotify, facebook, etc and would offer "cheap education with guaranteed success for your future". This type of situation has become so common and we see it everyday with the ads that are targeted to specific people based on their internet algorithm.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think that the beauty of the internet is the sense of freedom is allows for people when it comes to communication and access to information. But when we become victims to companies, who use methods like storing our data or tracking our digital footsteps as a way to target us for ads, I personally think it's a bit of a invasion of privacy. I believe that ads do influence the things that we choose to buy or click on. Therefore, when we are exposed to these types of predatory ads it does feel like the general public is not treated equally. Further, in a sense, it is a reflection that we are seem as algorithms rather than real human being by corporations.</p>
